As a data analyst, I was given a dataset containing records of previous hires.  My job is to analyze this data and answer certain questions that can help the company improve its hiring process.

Here's what I did:

Handling Missing Data: Check if there are any missing values in the dataset. If there are, decide on the best strategy to handle them.
Clubbing Columns: If there are columns with multiple categories that can be combined, do so to simplify your analysis.
Outlier Detection: Check for outliers in the dataset that may skew your analysis.
Removing Outliers: Decide on the best strategy to handle outliers. This could be removing them, replacing them, or leaving them as is, depending on the situation.
Data Summary: After cleaning and preparing your data, summarize findings. This involves calculating averages, medians, or other statistical measures. It could also involve creating visualizations to better understand the data.
